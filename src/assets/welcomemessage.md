Hello! Welcome to the DIG server, I'm your friendly neighbourhood bot. Let me give you a quick run-down on how things
 work around here.

For the best Discord experience, make sure you download the Desktop client: https://discordapp.com/api/download . We
 also recommend that you turn on the "Game Activity" option within the desktop version, which will grant you access
to our game specific channels automatically. More info on this can be found here:
https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/217960107-Games-Detection-101

__**Quickstart Guide:**__
 - Our community plays many games, to keep our discord clutter-free, a lot of channels are hidden, if you want to see a
 channel that you don't have access to simply type "*@Staff can I see the (your game) channel*" in the entrance/general
 channel and we'll get you the roles you need to access them.
 - Our bot is smart enough to know when you're playing games, so if you play a game that's in our community games list,
 we'll automatically subscribe you to the appropiate Discord channels.
 - We are a mature gaming community, however we ask that anything NSFW goes into the #herebedragons channel. What you
 see there is not moderated and never will be. You have been warned. This channel is an opt-in channel. In order to gain
 access, type the command **!dragons** and you'll be granted access.

__**Bot Guide:**__
 - The only command you'll have to remember is "**!help**", type that in the command channel and a list of commands will
 appear.
 - If you are part of the DIG outfit in Planetside 2 you can assign the ps2dig role to yourself using the "**!ps2dig**"
 command providing it with you character name.
